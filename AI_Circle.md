# AI\_Circle

## Installation \(First Week\)

This week\('21.4.12 ~ '21. 4. 16\), we are going to classify some datasets\(MNIST\) with tensorflow.

Let's proceed assuming that you have installed **python**, **Anaconda** and **tensorflow** after looking at the paper handed out in the first OT.

If you didn't install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), click the link and type command below in python.

\(If you also didn't install python, there is a download link below. You should install python before install tensorflow or anaconda\)

```text
$ pip install --upgrade pip
```

```text
$ pip install tensorflow
```

```text
$ pip install tf-nightly
```

Then, tensorflow install is finished.



The installations of [**python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) are very easy, So i have skipped it.

 But if you didn't install it, click the link.

## Jupyter\_notebook

I recommend you to use Colab or Jupyter\_notebook. It enable python to be run in web.

I prefer Jupyter\_notebook, so I will introduce with using it.

After you install Anaconda, run '**Anaconda Navigator**' 

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

Then, you can see screen like this.

Click 'launch'button below Notebook.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

Then, click the 'New' button and then click 'Python 3'. You can ignore many folders above.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

Then you can see screen like this.

Finally, I will introduce the basic shortcut keys before go into practice.

**'Ctrl + Enter'** : Run cell

**'Alt + Enter'** : Create cell below after run cell

**'Ctrl + Z'** : undo

**'Ctrl + Y'** : redo

Now you're ready to use notebook to classify many MNIST data sets.

## Tensorflow : Quickstart for beginners

Now, let's practice. You can type below codes in Jupyter\_notebook\(recommended\).

I have introduced how to use notebook above, so check it if you don't know how to use it.



We need tensorflow, so import it.

```text

Great job. If you want to know more about this tutorial or other tutorials, go [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)

**Goal : raise accuracy up to 99%**

\*\*\*\*

## Raising up Accuracy \(Second Week\)

Last week\(4. 12 ~ 4. 16\), We have installed **python**, **anaconda**, **tensorflow**.

And we have run the code of tutorial\(tensorflow : quickstart for beginners\)



This week\('21. 4. 19 ~ '21. 4. 23\) , We will make the accuracy up to 98% or more higher.

So how can we do that? Let's go practicicing.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hint : the more many epochs, the more higher accuracy
{% endhint %}



Below picture is an example of increased accuracy 

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2814%29.png)

There are many ways to increase accuracy.



Adjusting the value of \(**epoch**, **dropout**\) can increases the accuracy.

Also use different Activation & Loss function such as

\(**Sigmoid**, **Softmax**\) in Activation function or \(**Cross-entropy**, **Binary-entropy**\) to increase accuracy.

The MNIST datasets used in the tutorial are relatively easy to classify, so even a simple method can increase the accuracy up to 99%.

If you are curious about the principle of the above methods, not only by simply changing the value, but also increasing the accuracy, please refer to the following



### Epoch

Epoch refers to one cycle through the full training dataset. Usually, training a neural network takes more than a few epochs. In other words, if we feed a neural network the training data for more than one epoch in different patterns, we hope for a better generalization when given a new "unseen" input . 

An epoch is often mixed up with an iteration. Iterations is the number of batches or steps through partitioned packets of the training data, needed to complete one epoch.  Heuristically, one motivation is that \(especially for large but finite training sets\) it gives the network a chance to see the previous data to readjust the model parameters so that the model is not biased towards the last few data points during training.  

Simply put, epoch means the number of times all data has been learned once.

\*\*\*\*

### Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in artificial neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data.

The term dropout refers to randomly "dropping out", or omitting, units \(both hidden and visible\) during the training process of a neural network.

![Srivastava, Nitish, et al. &#x201D;Dropout: a simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting&#x201D;, JMLR 2014](.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

With above picture, you can easily understand the principle of 'Drop out'

### Activation Function

What is Activation Function?

There are many Activation Functions.

![source : https://docs.paperspace.com/machine-learning/wiki/activation-function](.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

But commonly, we almost use **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, **Softmax** functions.

Simply, the function of activation function is like this.

 input data =&gt; {activation function} =&gt; output data



**ReLU :**

![source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier\_\(neural\_networks\)](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

If the input value is less than 0, it outputs as 0, and if it is greater than 0, it outputs the input value as it is.

\*\*\*\*

**Sigmoid** :

![Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid\_function](.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

A function that adjusts the value from the output node in the range of 0 to 1.



**Softmax** :

A function that has the condition that all values ​​in the output node fall within the range of 0 to 1, and all values ​​are added together to become 1.

You can refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function)



### Loss Function

What is Loss Function?

Loss function defines the difference of value between outpude node & right answer



#### MSE

MSE function usually used in the purpose of regression using deep\_learning models.



![source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean\_squared\_error](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e258221518869aa1c6561bb75b99476c4734108e)

The result of MSE function is the squared of difference between the output value and the correct answer.



#### **Categorical Cross-entropy**

Categorical cross entropy is used for multiclass classification, i.e. when there are more than 3 classes to be classified.

It is used when the label is provided in one-hot format such as \[0,0,1,0,0\], \[1,0,0,0,0\], \[0,0,0,1,0\].



Additionally, we used sparse-categorical cross-entropy in tutorial.

It is used when labels come in the form of integers, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

## Fashion MNIST Classifciation \(Third Week\)

Last week\(4. 17 ~ 5. 17\), We have classified the basic MNIST(quickstart for beginners : MNIST).   
This week, let's classify the datasets of fashion_MNIST   
It's funny and interesting   
   
Firstable, go to link(https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)   
In the guide of link, it uses Fully-connected-layer to classify.   
It also uses matplot library to visualize some processing of classifying   
We can visualize by making graphs of datas or accuracy with matplot library. <br>  
  
So, What is FashionMNIST? :
FashionMNIST is a dataset which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categorie
   
## SourceCode
Copy and paste below codes of FashionMNIST
<br>
We need Tensorflow, keras, numpy and matplotlib so import them by pasting below codes.   
```Python
# TensorFlow and tf.keras
import tensorflow as tf

# Helper libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print(tf.__version__)
```   
    
Load and save fashionMNIST datasets as an variable '(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels)' 
```Python
fashion_mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
```
      
Below classes is an label of datasets. We classify many datas to this labels.
```Python
class_names = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat',
               'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']
```     
   
Confirm the (shape, length) of images of train datasets, print the shape of labels of train sets
```Python               
train_images.shape
len(train_labels)
train_labels
```
   
Confirm the shape of images of train datasets, print the length of labels of train sets
```Python
test_images.shape
len(test_labels)
```
   
Visualizing
```Python
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(train_images[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid(False)
plt.show()
```
   
Preprocessing : Scale the value(channels) of dataset to a range of 0 to 1 by diving it into 255.
```Python
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
```
   
To verify that the data is in the correct format and that you're ready to build and train the network, let's display the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image.
```Python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i]])
plt.show()
```
   
Set up the layers. The model uses Fully connected layer. 
```Python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```
   
Before the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's compile step:

Loss function —This measures how accurate the model is during training. You want to minimize this function to "steer" the model in the right direction.
Optimizer —This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
Metrics —Used to monitor the training and testing steps. The following example uses accuracy, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.
```Python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```      
  
To start training, call the model.fit method—so called because it "fits" the model to the training data:
```Python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)
```
  
Next, compare how the model performs on the test dataset:
```Python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images,  test_labels, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```
   
With the model trained, you can use it to make predictions about some images.
```Python
probability_model = tf.keras.Sequential([model,tf.keras.layers.Softmax()])
predictions = probability_model.predict(test_images)
```                                         
  
Let's take a look at the first prediction:                                         
```Python                                         
predictions[0]
```
  
A prediction is an array of 10 numbers.
```Python
np.argmax(predictions[0])
```
   
If you paste the below code, you can see the ouput(9). It means that the model predicts data to be class_number(9) which is an ankle boot class.

```Python
test_labels[0]
```
Graph this to look at the full set of 10 class predictions.
```Python
def plot_image(i, predictions_array, true_label, img):
  true_label, img = true_label[i], img[i]
  plt.grid(False)
  plt.xticks([])
  plt.yticks([])

  plt.imshow(img, cmap=plt.cm.binary)

  predicted_label = np.argmax(predictions_array)
  if predicted_label == true_label:
    color = 'blue'
  else:
    color = 'red'

  plt.xlabel("{} {:2.0f}% ({})".format(class_names[predicted_label],
                                100*np.max(predictions_array),
                                class_names[true_label]),
                                color=color)
                                
def plot_value_array(i, predictions_array, true_label):
  true_label = true_label[i]
  plt.grid(False)
  plt.xticks(range(10))
  plt.yticks([])
  thisplot = plt.bar(range(10), predictions_array, color="#777777")
  plt.ylim([0, 1])
  predicted_label = np.argmax(predictions_array)

  thisplot[predicted_label].set_color('red')
  thisplot[true_label].set_color('blue')
```
  
With the model trained, you can use it to make predictions about some images.<br>
Let's look at the 0th image, predictions, and prediction array. Correct prediction labels are blue and incorrect prediction labels are red. The number gives the percentage (out of 100) for the predicted label.
```Python  
i = 0
plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plot_image(i, predictions[i], test_labels, test_images)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plot_value_array(i, predictions[i],  test_labels)
plt.show()
```
  
Copy and Paste below code.
```Python
i = 12
plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plot_image(i, predictions[i], test_labels, test_images)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plot_value_array(i, predictions[i],  test_labels)
plt.show()
```
  
Let's plot several images with their predictions. Note that the model can be wrong even when very confident.
```Python
# Plot the first X test images, their predicted labels, and the true labels.
# Color correct predictions in blue and incorrect predictions in red.
num_rows = 5
num_cols = 3
num_images = num_rows*num_cols
plt.figure(figsize=(2*2*num_cols, 2*num_rows))
for i in range(num_images):
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+1)
  plot_image(i, predictions[i], test_labels, test_images)
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+2)
  plot_value_array(i, predictions[i], test_labels)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
   
Finally, use the trained model to make a prediction about a single image.
```Python
# Grab an image from the test dataset.
img = test_images[1]
print(img.shape)
```
   
Copy and Paste below code.
```Python
# Add the image to a batch where it's the only member.
img = (np.expand_dims(img,0))
print(img.shape)
```
   
Now predict the correct label for this image:
```Python
predictions_single = probability_model.predict(img)
print(predictions_single)
```
   
Copy and Paste below code.
```Python
plot_value_array(1, predictions_single[0], test_labels)
_ = plt.xticks(range(10), class_names, rotation=45)
```
tf.keras.Model.predict returns a list of lists—one list for each image in the batch of data. Grab the predictions for our (only) image in the batch:
```Python
np.argmax(predictions_single[0])
```
   
Well done, tutorials of FashionMNIST is finished.   
The goal of this week is to edit this model from FCN(fully-connected network) into CNN(Convolutional neural network)   
The way to change FCL into CNN is not so difficult.    
You have to just change the model with using Convolution layer   
You can raise up the accuracy by editing the model.   
  
Hope you guys succeed in classifying this FashionMNIST datasets with using Convolution    
   
If you feel so hard to make CNN, Don't worry.   
I will load the file of based CNN_FashionMNIST model.
   
You can edit the file with using of (Data Augmentation, changing hyper_parameters such as [epochs, structure of model, batchsize])   
With the above technologies, the accuracy can be raised up.   

### Change above basic Net into CNN   
#### Normalizing(Fully_Connected_Network)   
```Python
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
```   

Change above code to Below(FCN->CNN)   
#### Normalizing(CNN)   
```Python
#Normalizing
train_images = train_images/255
train_images = train_images.astype('float32')
test_images = test_images/255
test_images = test_images.astype('float32')
train_images = train_images.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
test_images = test_images.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
```   
   
#### Model(Fully_Connected_Network)   
```Python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
```   

Change above code to Below(Fully_Connected_Network->Vanilla_CNN)   
#### Model(Vanilla_CNN)   
```Python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same', input_shape=(28,28,1)),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same'),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, 3, padding='same'),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```   
Adding Activation Function(such as ReLU), Dropout, Maxpooling or other things can raises up Accuracy.   
Good Luck!!
